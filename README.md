The CGTV algorithm is implemented based on the core method described in the paper [X. Yang et al., Opt. Express, 23: 5368, 2015].
The ISTA and FISTA algorithms were originally developed by Yunhui Gao, whose GitHub homepage (https://github.com/Yunhui-Gao) provides a detailed introduction to the ISTA and FISTA algorithms.
